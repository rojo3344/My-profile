        <p>
          My name is Robert Joseph, I am a former professional basketball
          player who transitioned into the tech world.
          I am a self-taught developer whose primary focus has been in creating web-based applications.

          If you are curious to know why I decided to make such a radical change, then
          the best and simple answer is "why not ?". In reality,
          most people that have been on both sides of the fence would agree that
          there are more similarities than differences.
